What is collection framework?
    Classes, Interfaces which are extended or implemented in such way to build this
    connection

Why do we need Collection framework?
    to organize our Data


interview perspective:
    What is the difference between .... (list) and .... (Set)?
    How did you use .... (linkedList) in your framework?
    we need to know collection framework verbally


Usage Perspective:
    * ArrayList
    * List
    * Set
    * Map, List of Maps
    * Arrays
Data - Store (group of Data)
Arrays (limited: fixed size , homogenious)

Benefits: Growable, Different types of Data, OOP Concepts-Polymorphism, Methods

sync: Running slow ( Vector) -- Thread-safe
not sync: faster (arraylist)

All collections are iterable. ( iterable is an object, which one can iterate over)

Traverse : travel from back to forward

List interface takes dublicate, index, keeps order
    allows null values
