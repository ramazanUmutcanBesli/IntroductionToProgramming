for loop: iteration is fixed
        for(initi; condition; iteration){
            statements
        }
        initialization: starting point
            int i =5;

        condition: ending point
            i< 10, i>=0
        iterator : Co-related to the condition. runs long enough to make the condition false
            i++ , i++


while loop: iteration is not fixed, repeated if
        while(condition){
            Statement
        }


do-While loop :iteration is not fixed
        do{
            statements
        }while(condition);




Nested loop : loop inside a loop (inner& outer)
outer loop repeats the inner

break;    exits the loop & switch
continue;  skips the current iteration of the loop
System.exit(0); terminates the current program
